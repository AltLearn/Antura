## [1.0.0] - 2019-02-18

**Prototype Alpha**

this is the first release of the Learn English with Antura.
it's fully functional but obviously lacks a lot of polish contents.

The learning course has been deployed just for Stage 1 with some basic words.
All the voice audio recordings are placeholders.

The app is developed to allow any "native / instructions language" (the one used to talk to the player) and "learning language" (the language to learn)

if you find any important bug, please let us know. the project is open source!
